We have decided the project and have started working on it .
We are  trying to design a simple multiple choice quiz game that basically allows user to answer series of  Questions and track their score on the basis of how many Questions they have answered correctly .
This project will help us explain the use of logical concepts and operators in the alogrithms of programs.
