Today, I expanded my understanding of how recursion is applied in algorithm development, particularly in solving complex problems through divide-and-conquer strategies. I explored how recursive logic is used to break down problems into manageable subproblems, improving both problem-solving and efficiency. By working through practical examples, I gained insights into optimizing recursive algorithms and analyzing their performance.
