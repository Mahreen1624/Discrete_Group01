Our topic is "Logical Structures in Algorithm Development". After our topic got approved by Saleha, we divided it into sub-topics and I got proof techniques. I started studying about proofs and they have a lot of applications in discrete mathematics. Proof of logical structures in algorithm development involves demonstrating the correctness and efficiency of algorithms using formal methods.
