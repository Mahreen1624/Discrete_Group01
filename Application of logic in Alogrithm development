I have started working on the subtopic "Application of logic in Alogrithm development". This is the workflow outline I have made so far :-
1)Core Logical structures in alogrithms:-
      .Conditional Statements
      .Loops and Iteration
      .Recursion
2)Logic in common Alogrithms:-
    .Sorting and Structuring 
    .Data Structure and Logic 
3)Example:-
  .Binary Search
4)Conclusion
